* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? 

  **I wasn't struggling in any of the concepts thus far, but I was exposed to the "fetch" and subsequent merge practice to update local repositories.**

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

  **As mentioned above, we were exposed to the "fetch" command and it was really useful. We also got help on the possible other scenarios that might cause a merge conflict such as file deletion in a sub branch.**

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

  **Questions for this very first GPS were limited. We asked whether or not we should pipe the history to the README and what exactly the "fetched" command did. I am to assume the main intent was to get situated with how we are to work with future pairing sessions either with a guide or without. The task itself was easy, but we definitely needed a bit of getting to know how to transition work from GitHub and our local machines.**

* What still confuses you about Git?

  **At the moment, nothing is bothering me about it. However, I am not a master at bash nor git/GitHub, so only time will tell.**

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

  **It was pretty awesome. Definitely felt like the guide was there to help us even if he is tasked to be quite minimal. It was also a nice thing to work with another student who, more or less, had the same limited knowledge as I did.**
